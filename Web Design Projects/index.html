        <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>1914</h3>
            - Born in Cresco, Iowa
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>1933</h3>
            - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,
            thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth
            Administration"
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>1935</h3>
            - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian
            Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food
            changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>1937</h3>
            - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>1938</h3>
            - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to
            budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school
            study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent
            plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>1941</h3>
            - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but
            is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on
            waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other
            applied science.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>2005</h3>
            - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050."
            Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet
            the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not
            inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
            plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it
            science, people were selecting the best breeds."
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>2009</h3>
            - dies at the age of 95.
